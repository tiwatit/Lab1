Rerun is an Apache 2 or later licensed utility.  Many files distributed in
the rerun distribution are generated by autoconf which are GPL v3 or later.
These GPL files are a dependency on the build system and are independent
works not used during normal runtime use of rerun.

Since this is a github project and an autoconf project, the
README file is not used, README.md is the file to READ!

You'll probably have to install automake/automconf/rpmdevtools
("yum install automake rpmdevtools" in a CentOS/Red Hat box).

When you checkout the file, run "setup.sh" which gets autoconf initialized.
Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.  Real standard stuff...

   o  Use 'make check' to run the tests
   o  Use 'make rpm' to create an RPM for your platform after 
      you've run setup.sh.
